# â€” airline-reviews-sentiment-analysis.ipynb


## Project scope (notebook-only)
- Objective: Explore airline review text and build simple supervised models to predict sentiment (e.g., positive/negative/neutral) from review text.
- Primary tasks implemented in the notebook:
  - Load and inspect the airline reviews dataset (text + label).
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (class balance, text length, common words/phrases).
  - Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords handling; optional lemmatization/stemming).
  - Convert text to numeric features (CountVectorizer / TF-IDF).
  - Train and compare baseline classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).
  - Evaluate models with standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and visualize results (confusion matrix, word clouds).
  - Perform simple error analysis and summarize findings.

## Notebook structure (section-by-section)
- Title & Overview
  - Short description of the objective and dataset used.
- Setup / Imports
  - Required Python imports, plotting configuration, and any environment flags (random_state).
  - NLTK downloads if used (stopwords, punkt, wordnet).
- Data Loading
  - Load CSV (or other) into a DataFrame and show sample rows and schema.
  - Notes on where to set the dataset path within the notebook.
- Initial Inspection
  - Missing values, basic statistics, label distribution.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Visualizations: class counts, review length distribution, most frequent words and n-grams.
- Text Preprocessing
  - Cleaning pipeline: lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stopword removal, optional lemmatization.
  - Example transformed text samples.
- Feature Engineering
  - Vectorization approaches (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF) and parameter choices (ngram range, max_features).
- Modeling & Training
  - Train/test split, model training blocks for each classifier, cross-validation if included.
- Evaluation
  - Metrics computation, confusion matrix plots, classification reports.
- Error Analysis / Insights
  - Examples of misclassified reviews, qualitative observations, limitations.
- Conclusions & Recommendations
  - Summary of best-performing approaches in the notebook and suggested next experiments.
- Appendix / Utilities
  - Helper functions, NLTK download cells, and any saved artifacts instructions (if present in the notebook).

## How to use the notebook (brief)
- Open the notebook in Jupyter / JupyterLab or Colab.
- Adjust the dataset path near the Data Loading cell to point to your reviews CSV (the notebook expects a text column and a label column).
- Run cells sequentially from top to bottom to reproduce the analysis. Ensure NLTK resources are downloaded if required.
- To get repeatable results, run training cells with fixed seeds (random_state) as set in the notebook.
